# mc-exercise

This was a bit of a disaster.  

In the workflow described in the exercise, Bob and Carol should have a fresh pull from Master before starting the 2nd feature branch.  Since the 2nd set of branches started from different pulls, Github had no basis for determining which was the correct basis from which to make changes.

We made it a bit extra "colorful" by not carefully following the directions... we got ahead of one another and made it even more broken than the exercise would have made it.  The result was that we had to blow up the local repo on a couple of machines before we could move forward.  We'll take note of that as we move into project week... it's likely a reflection of some "growth opportunities" for us.
